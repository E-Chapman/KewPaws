### Project in progress
I'm mad about rescue dogs and I'm building an animal charity website (Next.js, TypeScript, React) as in the future, I'd love to donate time to charities to brighten up their sites 🐕 I am currently working on a wireframe in Figma. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
